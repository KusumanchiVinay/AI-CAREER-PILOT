## 🚀 Problem Statements & Solutions

### 1. Lack of Career Guidance

**Problem:** When starting a career, we often seek guidance from experienced professionals who can offer insights and recommendations. However, finding a knowledgeable mentor is not always easy.

**Solution:** AI Career Pilot offers an **AI Career Advisor** that provides personalized career recommendations based on your skills, interests, and market trends, helping you make informed decisions about your career path.

### 2. Difficulty in Building a Portfolio

**Problem:** A professional portfolio acts as proof of work and increases the chances of career opportunities. However, creating a well-structured portfolio from scratch can be time-consuming and challenging.

**Solution:** Our **AI-Powered Portfolio Generator** allows users to instantly generate a professional portfolio website with just a single prompt, making it easier than ever to showcase work and achievements.

### 3. No Clear Roadmap for Skill Development

**Problem:** When entering a new field or learning a new skill, we often struggle to find a well-structured, step-by-step roadmap that outlines what to learn and how to progress.

**Solution:** AI Career Pilot provides a **Roadmap for Success**, a customized learning and skill development plan that guides users through acquiring the necessary skills and certifications for their desired career.
